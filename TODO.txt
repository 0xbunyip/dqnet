TODO:
- Test Q-learning and Network with small grid game
- Add evaluation module
- Split train and evaluation experience
- Add epsilon to get_action (evaluation action has different epsilon)
- Save network's weight and report loss/reward each epoch
- Clip error term of Q-learning update to [-1, 1]
- Clip reward of each step to [-1, 1]
- Add random actions at the start of each episode
- (AND/OR) check number of observations have been seen at the start of each episode
- Unify Random number generators
- Change RMSProp parameters
- Test speed on GPU
- Add function descriptions and comments
- Move half experiences to GPU

DONE:
